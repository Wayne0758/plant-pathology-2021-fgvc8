# Overview
◦ Utilized techniques of Machine Learning to accomplish the sophisticated work of identifying 6 heterogeneous apple diseases, resulting in accelerating curing and preventing pandemic
◦ Exploited Multilabel-encoding to divide every hybrid label into 6 labels with binary code in order to explicitly assort every individual disease, resulting in a higher F1-Score
◦ Adapted myriad Batch Sizes and Data Augmentation, applied Resnet18 and Inception_V3 in the training set, and then made the comparison, resulting in 0.76387 points and 292 places in 626 competitors (Top 46.65%) on Kaggle
# F1score
$Precision = \frac{TP}{TP+FP}$
$Recall = \frac{TP}{TP+FN}$
